  <h1>The Animation Curve Editor</h1>
  <p><img alt="The Animation Curve Editor" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Animation_Curves.png"/>An animation curve is an asset that contains one or more curves that represent how a value changes over time, and can use <a class="tooltip" title="Linear interpolation involves estimating a new value by connecting two adjacent known values with a straight line. You can then get the interpolated value by checking any point along the line. In graphics, linear interpolation refers to a basic method of smoothing pixel edges.">linear interpolation</a> or <a class="tooltip" title="Smooth interpolation involves estimating a new value by connecting two adjacent known values with a mathematically generated spline curve . You can then get the interpolated value by checking any point along the line.">smooth interpolation</a> to go between different points in the curve. The values you set on the vertical
    axis can be between any two values (between -1 and 1 by default) and the duration along the horizontal axis is <em>always </em>normalised form 0 to 1, making it easy to target different time ranges using multipliers in your game code or stretch them
    to fit a track in the <a href="Sequence_Properties/Using_Animation_Curves.htm">Sequences Editor</a>.</p>
  <p>Animation curves are comprised of &quot;channels&quot; and each channel can have its own curve settings, which permits you to - for example - describe a spacial position with two channels for the x/y location, or a colour gradient with 4 channels to
    represent a colour format. Animation curve assets can be used when working with Sequences and can also be accessed using code, making them a powerful tool when creating your games.</p>
  <p>When you first create an animation curve asset the editor window will open and present you with the following sections:</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true">Curve Name</span><span data-close-text="true">Curve Name</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p class="dropspot">Here you can give your animation curve a unique name (alpha numeric characters and the &quot;_&quot; under-bar symbol only). This name is what will be used to refer to the curve and all its channels when accessing it through code or in a sequence.</p>
    <p class="dropspot"> </p>
  </div>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down1" href="#"><span data-open-text="true">Channel List</span><span data-close-text="true">Channel List</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down1">
    <p class="dropspot">The channel list is where you can add and name the different channels that will comprise your animation curve asset. By default when you first create an animation curve, a channel will have been added for you and you can add further channels by clicking
      the &quot;
      <strong>Add Channel</strong>&quot; button at the bottom. Each channel must have a unique name (using alpha numeric characters and the &quot;_&quot; under-bar symbol only), and you can also set the colour for the channel by double clicking
      <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/> on the colour swatch to the left, which will open the colour picker to let you choose a new colour. To rename the channel, you can do a slow double click
      <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"/> and rename, and you can also use the right mouse button
      <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"/> to open a menu where you can choose to rename, change the colour or delete the channel.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Channels can be expanded by clicking the arrow beside the name to show each of the points on the channel curve, and these points can be edited manually by clicking the current value and typing in the new value:</p>
    <p class="dropspot">
      <img alt="Expanded Channel List" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Animation_Curves_ExpandList.png"/>You can toggle the channel visibility by clicking on the &quot;eye&quot; icon
      <img alt="Eye Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ToggleVisibility.png"/>, or delete the channel by clicking the &quot;bin&quot; icon
      <img alt="Delete Channel Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_DeleteChannel.png"/>. You can also change the way the channel flows from point to point by clicking the channel type icon
      <img alt="Channel Type Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ChannelType.png"/>. This will switch between linear interpolation or smooth interpolation (smooth interpolation uses centripetal

      change the way the data is represented in the Channel Editor section, permitting you to have higher/lower values along the channel curve than just -1 to 1. Note that this is purely visual and is not used to clamp the values for the channel.
