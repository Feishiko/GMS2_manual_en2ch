The values you set on the vertical\n    axis can be between any two values (between -1 and 1 by default) and the duration along the horizontal axis is ","always ","normalised form 0 to 1, making it easy to target different time ranges using multipliers in your game code or stretch them\n    to fit a track in the ","Sequences Editor",".","\n  ","Animation curves are comprised of \"channels\" and each channel can have its own curve settings, which permits you to - for example - describe a spacial position with two channels for the x/y location, or a colour gradient with 4 channels to\n    represent a colour format. Animation curve assets can be used when working with Sequences and can also be accessed using code, making them a powerful tool when creating your games.","\n  ","When you first create an animation curve asset the editor window will open and present you with the following sections:","\n  ","Curve Name","Curve Name","\n  ","\n    ","Here you can give your animation curve a unique name (alpha numeric characters and the \"_\" under-bar symbol only). This name is what will be used to refer to the curve and all its channels when accessing it through code or in a sequence.","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Channel List","Channel List","\n  ","\n    ","The channel list is where you can add and name the different channels that will comprise your animation curve asset. By default when you first create an animation curve, a channel will have been added for you and you can add further channels by clicking\n      the \"\n      ","Add Channel","\" button at the bottom. Each channel must have a unique name (using alpha numeric characters and the \"_\" under-bar symbol only), and you can also set the colour for the channel by double clicking\n      "," on the colour swatch to the left, which will open the colour picker to let you choose a new colour. To rename the channel, you can do a slow double click\n      "," and rename, and you can also use the right mouse button\n      "," to open a menu where you can choose to rename, change the colour or delete the channel.","\n    ","Channels can be expanded by clicking the arrow beside the name to show each of the points on the channel curve, and these points can be edited manually by clicking the current value and typing in the new value:","\n    ","\n      ","You can toggle the channel visibility by clicking on the \"eye\" icon\n      ",", or delete the channel by clicking the \"bin\" icon\n      ",". You can also change the way the channel flows from point to point by clicking the channel type icon\n      ",".

By default, all channels will be shown here, but you can only edit the channel currently selected from the Channel List, which will be highlighted\n      in the editor (all other channels will be represented by a faded line only). You can change the current time position using the\n      ","playhead"," bar (the yellow bar) by clicking\n      "," on it and dragging, and you can change the position of any of the points along the channel curve by clicking\n      "," on them and dragging them around within the editor. Note that the first and last point can only be changed along\n      the vertical axis and their horizontal value will always be 0 and 1 respectively.","\n    ","You can add points directly to the channel curve by moving the mouse close to the main channel line and then clicking\n      "," when the cursor changes to the \"\n      ","Add Point","\" tool, and you can then edit these points by clicking\n      "," and dragging or by changing their values in the expanded channel options in the Channel List:\n      ","\n    ","\n      ","You can edit multiple\n      points at once by clicking\n      "," and dragging within the editor to select all the points you want to edit or by using\n      "," /\n      "," +\n      "," to add points to the selection individually.
