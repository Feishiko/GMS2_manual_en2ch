Both the buffer and the surface must have been created previously. You can choose the copy \"mode\" for the data being stored which is set by the constants listed\n    below, as well as the offset and modulo values. Both offset and modulo are byte values, with the offset defining the start position within the buffer and modulo being the number of bytes that were left at the end of every line (for storing additional\n    data) when the buffer was written to.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Constant","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","buffer_surface_copy","\n        ","Copies all data from the buffer.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","buffer_set_surface(buffer, surface, mode, offset, modulo);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","buffer","\n        ","The index of the buffer to use.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","surface","\n        ","The index of the surface to use.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","mode","\n        ","The data to get from the buffer (see the list of constants above).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","offset","\n        ","The data offset value.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","modulo","\n        ","The offset from the end of the line to the start of the next","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","buffer_set_surface(buff, application_surface, 0, 0, 0);","\n  ","The above code will copy all the data stored in the buffer indexed in the variable \"buff\" to the application surface with no offset or modulo values.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Buffers","\n        ","Next: ","buffer_resize","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["buffer_set_surface"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"2470"})
