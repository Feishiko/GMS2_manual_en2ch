However, games in GameMaker Studio 2 generally have rooms that follow a certain order, and at the very least must have a specific ","start room"," (after\n    the game starts in this room you can use code or actions to go to any room in the game if you wish), which is where the ","Room Manager"," comes into play.","\n  ","You can open the room manager by clicking the \"Extras\" button "," at the top of the Asset Browser and selecting it from the menu that opens, or you can\n    simply click "," the icon to the left of a room in the asset browser:","\n  ","Once open, the Room Manager presents you with two different tabs, one for ","Room Order"," and one for ","Room Inheritance",".\n    The room order defines the order in which rooms will be accessed if you are traversing the game literally, using the function ","room_goto_next()"," at\n    the end of each room, and the very top room listed will always be flagged by the \"home\" icon ",", which shows you that this room is the designated\n    ","start ","room for the game. This icon will also be shown in the Asset browser so you can see clearly which room it is, regardless of the how you have filtered or set up your assets.","\n  ","You can change the order of rooms by simply clicking "," and dragging the room you want to move up or down the list, and you can use "," and/or "," / "," to select multiple rooms then click and drag them to move them altogether:","\n  ","The ","Room Inheritance"," tab is for setting up \"child\" rooms. A child room is one that has been copied from\n    a \"parent\" room and set to inherit all it's properties. If you do nothing to this room, then this room will indeed be a copy of the original room, but you can then go into the ","Room Editor","    and toggle inheritance on or off for specific things like layer, or instances, as well as add new layers, instances and properties to the room.","\n  ","As with the Room Order tab, you can click "," and drag to reorder the rooms, but note that selecting a child room and moving it to a different parent will break the room inheritance with the original parent and it will instead inherit the properties of the new room. Note too that you can convert\n    a child into a \"full\" room with no inheritance by dragging it to the left of the list (the list border will become highlighted), at which point it will simply become a room in its own right.","\n  ","Rooms can have multiple children, and each child can also be a parent and have their own children, for example:","\n  ","Here we have a parent room, \"","rm_Level1_Day","\", which has two children\n    \"","rm_Level1_Day_AfterBattle","\" and \"","rm_Level1_Night","\". We have also assigned another child room to \"","rm_Level1_Night","\" called \"","rm_Level1_Night_AfterBattle","\".\n    In this way you can re-use resources and level design from one parent room, and then only change what is required to make it slightly different in the child room or rooms.","\n  ","For more information on room inheritance, please see ","here",".","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Game Settings","\n        ","Next: ","Included Files","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["The Room Manager"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"139"})
