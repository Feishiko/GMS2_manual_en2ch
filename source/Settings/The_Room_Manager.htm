  <h1>The Room Manager</h1>
  <p><img alt="The Room Manager" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Room_Manager.png" style="cursor: nesw-resize;"/>When using the <a href="../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm">Asset Browser</a>, you can create your rooms and move them between
    the different folder groups to organise the project in a way that best suits you. However, games in GameMaker Studio 2 generally have rooms that follow a certain order, and at the very least must have a specific <strong>start room</strong> (after
    the game starts in this room you can use code or actions to go to any room in the game if you wish), which is where the <strong>Room Manager</strong> comes into play.</p>
  <p>You can open the room manager by clicking the &quot;Extras&quot; button <img alt="Extras Menu Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_AssetMenu.png"/> at the top of the Asset Browser and selecting it from the menu that opens, or you can
    simply click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> the icon to the left of a room in the asset browser:</p>
  <p><img alt="Opening The Room Manager" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Room_Manager_Open.gif"/>Once open, the Room Manager presents you with two different tabs, one for <strong>Room Order</strong> and one for <strong>Room Inheritance</strong>.
    The room order defines the order in which rooms will be accessed if you are traversing the game literally, using the function <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/room_goto_next.htm"><span class="inline">room_goto_next()</span></a> at
    the end of each room, and the very top room listed will always be flagged by the &quot;home&quot; icon <img alt="Room Manager Home Room Icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/icon_RoomManager_Home.png"/>, which shows you that this room is the designated
    <em>start </em>room for the game. This icon will also be shown in the Asset browser so you can see clearly which room it is, regardless of the how you have filtered or set up your assets.</p>
  <p>You can change the order of rooms by simply clicking <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> and dragging the room you want to move up or down the list, and you can use <img alt="Shift Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Shift.png" width="55"/> and/or <img alt="Control Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55"/> / <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55"/> to select multiple rooms then click and drag them to move them altogether:</p>
  <p><img alt="Moving Rooms Within The Room Manager" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Room_Manager_Move.gif"/>The <strong>Room Inheritance</strong> tab is for setting up &quot;child&quot; rooms. A child room is one that has been copied from
    a &quot;parent&quot; room and set to inherit all it&#39;s properties. If you do nothing to this room, then this room will indeed be a copy of the original room, but you can then go into the <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Rooms.htm">Room Editor</a>    and toggle inheritance on or off for specific things like layer, or instances, as well as add new layers, instances and properties to the room.</p>
  <p><img alt="The Room Inheritance Tab" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Room_Manager_Inheritance.png"/>As with the Room Order tab, you can click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> and drag to reorder the rooms, but note that selecting a child room and moving it to a different parent will break the room inheritance with the original parent and it will instead inherit the properties of the new room. Note too that you can convert
    a child into a &quot;full&quot; room with no inheritance by dragging it to the left of the list (the list border will become highlighted), at which point it will simply become a room in its own right.</p>
  <p>Rooms can have multiple children, and each child can also be a parent and have their own children, for example:</p>
  <p><img alt="Example Of Room Inheritance With Multiple Children" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Room_Manager_Inheritance_Example.png"/>Here we have a parent room, &quot;<span class="inline">rm_Level1_Day</span>&quot;, which has two children
    &quot;<span class="inline">rm_Level1_Day_AfterBattle</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="inline">rm_Level1_Night</span>&quot;. We have also assigned another child room to &quot;<span class="inline">rm_Level1_Night</span>&quot; called &quot;<span class="inline">rm_Level1_Night_AfterBattle</span>&quot;.
    In this way you can re-use resources and level design from one parent room, and then only change what is required to make it slightly different in the child room or rooms.</p>
