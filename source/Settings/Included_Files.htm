  <h1>Included Files</h1>
  <p>GameMaker Studio 2 is not just limited to the assets that you create within the program, since you can add files to the project as <strong>Included Files</strong> so that they can then be accessed as the game is running. What files you add will depend
    on what you want to do, but things like default <span class="inline">*.ini</span> files, sprites and background images, or language text files are commonly used as included files.</p>
  <p>To add these things to your project there is an editor window that can be opened from the Asset Browser <b>Extras</b> menu <img alt="Extras Menu Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_AssetMenu.png"/>:</p>
  <p><img alt="Open The Included Files Editor" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Included_Files_Editor_Open.png"/>Selecting this will open the Included Files Editor:</p>
  <p><img alt="The Included Files Editor" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Included_Files.png"/>To add a file to your resources you simply use the <strong>Open In Explorer</strong> button, which will open a file explorer on the datafiles folder
    for your project. You can then add directories and files as required and GameMaker Studio 2 will update the indluded files editor with these automatically.</p>
  <p><img alt="Included Files Example" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Included_Files_Example.png"/>Note that all editing (renaming, organisation, etc...) <em>should be done from the default file explorer</em>.</p>
  <p>Once you have added files to the editor, you can double-click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21"/> on them to open up the <strong>File Properties</strong>:</p>
  <p><img alt="Included Files Properties" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Settings/Included_Files_Properties.png"/>This window shows the name of the file, its size on disk, and also the platforms that it should be exported to when you compile/test
    your game. You have buttons to select &quot;All&quot; or &quot;None&quot;, or you can go down the list and check/uncheck the tragets that you want the file to be exported to, as required.</p>
  <p>For further information on how included files are stored with your game and how they are accessed please see the section of the manual dedicated to the <a href="../Additional_Information/The_File_System.htm">File System</a>.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> When including sound files, you should ensure that the files avoid names that clash with streaming sound assets. For example, a sound asset called &quot;main_music&quot; and an included file called &quot;main_music.ogg&quot;
    is going to be undefined when the project runs. This is becuase streamed files are also stored outside of the main project bundle, so care must be taken in these situations.</p>
  <p>It is worth noting that you can include <span class="inline">DLL</span> (on Windows) or <span class="inline">DyLib</span> (on macOS) files as included files and then create your own custom functions to deal with them using <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/OS_And_Compiler/external_define.htm"><span class="inline">external_define()</span></a>.
    These can then be used calling the <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/OS_And_Compiler/external_call.htm"><span class="inline">external_call()</span></a> function.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>WARNING!</strong> Using included files to create extra functionality in this way is incompatible with the <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Extensions.htm">Extension</a> system, in so much as you cannot use use the <span style="font-size:1px;"><span class="inline" style="font-size: 14px">external_*()</span></span> functions
    with files added in an extension, since extensions already have a method for adding constants and functions.</p>
